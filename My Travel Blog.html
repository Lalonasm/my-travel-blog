            <h3><i><strong>First Journey experience</strong></i></h3>
        <p>A person's first journey experience can vary greatly 
            depending on factors such as their destination, mode of 
            transportation, purpose of the trip, and personal preferences.
             However, here's a generalized overview of what a first journey 
             experience might entail:</p>

                        <strong>Anticipation and Preparation:</strong> Before embarking on their journey, individuals often feel a mix of excitement and nervousness. They may spend time researching their destination, making travel arrangements, packing their belongings, and ensuring they have all necessary documents such as tickets, passports, visas, and accommodations booked.

                       <strong> Departure:</strong> On the day of departure, there's usually a flurry of activity as the traveler makes their way to the airport, train station, bus terminal, or other departure point. Saying goodbye to loved ones and setting off on their own or with companions can evoke a range of emotions.

                        <strong>Travel:</strong> The actual travel experience can be both thrilling and exhausting. Whether flying, driving, taking a train, or using another mode of transportation, there's a sense of adventure as the traveler covers distance and observes new surroundings. They may encounter unfamiliar landscapes, encounter different cultures, and interact with fellow travelers along the way.

This phase of the journey is often filled with discovery, wonder, and memorable experiences.
